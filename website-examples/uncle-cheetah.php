	    <h2>Uncle Cheetah's Soup Shop
      </h2>
	    <p>Uncle Cheetah's Soup Shop is the sister restaurant to Grand Rapids, Michigan's The Electric Cheetah. Uncle Cheetah's is known for having 12 high quality from scratch soups that change daily along with gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches, BBQ, salads and desserts. Multiple vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options are available daily. Uncle Cheetah's didn't previously have its own site, and was just a single page on the original Electric Cheetah website. This site was designed and built in tandem with The Electric Cheetah's new website, but is now a completely separate site with its own url. The goal of this website was to have it share design aspects of its sister restaurant, allow restaurant staff to update content, and showcase the menu and the 12 daily soups.
      </p>
      <p>This website is built on WordPress to address the important aspect of allowing restaurant staff to update the website in an easy to use interface. The design was a custom design that was created specifically for this website and it's sister site, The Electric Cheetah. The menu is an important aspect of this site, and due to the fact that the soups change daily the soup and other menu items had to be able to be easily updated and changed, hidden or displayed. All of the menu items and the categories they fall under are managed completely in WordPress. Menu items have titles, descriptions, prices and visibility settings. Things can be turned on and off with a simple click, depending on whatâ€™s on the menu that day. New menu items can also be added quickly to keep pace with the fast moving restaurant environment.
