	    <h2>Portland High School Athletics
      </h2>
	    <p>The Portland High School: Raider Athletics is a sports team specific information website is for a Michigan high school. The website’s focus is to make available rosters, schedules, history, and contact information for players, families and friends that are involved and interested in Raider sports. 
      </p>
      <p>Their website was designed and developed by Grand Rapids, MI based development agency which I was a part of at that time. I assisted in content collection, content population and training the client using their ExpressionEngine based CMS (content management system). After a few years the agency moved maintenance duties over to me as a freelance developer in agreement with the client. It was a great situation as PHS was in need of a maintenance support person and they were able to go with someone that was experienced with the ins and outs of their website and CMS. This is a nice example of a client that has a site developed with someone else, but I’m able to come in and assist with maintenance duties.
