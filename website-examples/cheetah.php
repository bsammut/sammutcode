	    <h2>The Electric Cheetah
      </h2>
	    <p>The Electric Cheetah is a highly respected and loved restaurant in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area. They are known for real food prepared from scratch using high quality, natural, local and organic ingredients, by real people who care about where your food comes from. This website was a redesign of their previous website. Their original site was just a few pages of content and the content was only available as downloadable PDF files. Hours, phone number and address where they only major bits of content. The major goals of the redesign/rebuild were to incorporate a modern design that gives visitors quick access to the two different menus the restaurant offers, the main contact info, an overview of the restaurant and access to the sister restaurant <a href="/website-examples/uncle-cheetah.php">Uncle Cheetah&rsquo;s Soup Shop</a>. The site also had to be built using a CMS (content management system) that would allow restaurant staff to easily and efficiently update content.
      </p>
      <p>This website is built on WordPress to address the important aspect of allowing restaurant staff to update the website in a very easy to use administration interface. The design was a custom design that was created specifically for this website and for its sister site. The Menu section of the website showcases the Lunch/Dinner and Brunch menus. It was important to the client that the menus appear exactly as they do to customers who come to the restaurant, and our solution was to publish the menu to the ISSUU third-party service and embed the ISSUU viewer into the pages. This allowed for more functionality than a PDF download would have. It gives visitors a crisp large view of the menu, which can easily be moved and scaled to the desired size. Itâ€™s as good as can be done short of putting the menu in their hands.
